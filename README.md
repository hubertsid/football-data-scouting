# football-data-scouting
This project explores data-driven football scouting using various machine learning and statistical methods. It includes a custom dataset, a Jupyter Notebook, and insights into scouting approaches such as weighted scoring models, clustering, and predictive machine learning models.

## Dataset
The dataset was created by combining two public sources. And also scraped my own data from 2024-2025 season that I plan to update weekly.

1️⃣ Football Player Stats (2022-2023 Season)📌 Source: Kaggle: 2022-2023 Football Player Stats📊 Includes: Player statistics (goals, assists, tackles, xG, etc.).

2️⃣ Transfer Market Valuations📌 Source: Kaggle: Player Scores & Valuations📈 Includes: Player market values from Transfermarkt up to January 2025.

3️⃣ Football Player stats (2024-2025 Season)📌 Source: Kaggle: Football Players Stats (2024-2025)

Merged datasets to create a comprehensive dataset for football scouting & market predictions:



## Notebook
The goal of this analysis is to explore different methods of data-driven scouting in football. The notebook consists of three key approaches:

1️⃣ Weighted Scoring Model for strikers (Machine Learning-Assisted)
Assigns weights to different player statistics.
Uses machine learning to optimize these weights.
Helps in ranking players based on their performance.

2️⃣ K-Means Clustering for midfielders(Role-Based Grouping)
Uses K-Means Clustering to categorize players into distinct roles.
Identifies similarity between players based on performance metrics.
Helps find undervalued players by comparing them to top performers.

3️⃣ Machine Learning Market Value Prediction for defenders
Uses ML models to predict market_value_profit.

Implements:
Random Forest Regressor

Evaluates results using MSE, MAE, and feature importance.
